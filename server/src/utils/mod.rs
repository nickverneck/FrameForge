//! Utility functions and helper modules.
//!
//! This module provides common utility functions used across the application:
//! - Image processing utilities (validation, format conversion, base64 encoding)
//! - Helper functions for file handling
//! - Common operations that don't belong to a specific domain module
//!
//! Utilities are designed to be stateless and reusable across different parts
//! of the application.
